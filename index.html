      however the place I have spent the longest in is Washington.
    </p>
    <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
    <p>I would say that I enjoy reading and anime the most however I am developing 
      a passion for learning linguistic languages and having grasped basic Japanese
      I am considering the next hurdle to be Mandarin.

    <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
    <p>My dream job would be one that allows me to travel the world as 
      I have grown a fondness for living in vastly different environments and

    <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
    <p>I like to create and alter but I am not especially skilled with my hands.
      I have always had however a fondness for technology and as such this field 
      seemed like a perfect mesh of the two.
